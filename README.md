# Text-As-Data
Time to automate some of that qualitative research

This is going to be an ongoing project as I work with more surveys and archival documents, but I need quicker and more efficient ways of parsing large bodies of text and doing keyword searches in Excel isn't going to cut it. ALl of the code in this repository will be done in the R programming language. I will be starting with regular expression than moving on to NLP as I find use cases for it.
